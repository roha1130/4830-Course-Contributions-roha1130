    "Keeping things in a \"frame of reference\" is key for me as well.  During my calc studies in undergrad I always had to remind myself that in calc there is always a \"tool box\" that you can pull from when solving for equations or variables.  This could be a rule or a previously used method that worked for another solve.  The main thing was remembering that it was a tool that can be used to further the solution.\n",

    "There are all sorts of SIR examples out there, I believe we've seen it before!  The pseudo code on page 69 is comprehensive and has everything.  The variables T, S, I, R, deltaT, range are given, but the day count and step count was something that I forgot on the first attempt.  I like to think of those variables as adjustments to the resolution of the output.  A lower day count will let you see how an infection spreads over the first week/week 1/2 as opposed to a 3 month plot.\n",

    "Think of the time steps as the resolution of the plot.  The number of steps will govern the number of 'snippets' of the SIR model that you will see as your loop runs.  The code provided uses the number of steps as a range for iteration.  Increasing the number will increase the smoothness of the plot but will take longer to run (more steps, more iterations).  The time window t is the number of days that will be shown of the SIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time frame of the SIR model (t, t initial, and t final) are basically the window that you want to look at for the infection.  If you were to put 90 days in for tfinal (assuming 0 for tinitial), with a recovery period of 10 days, the graph would have the infection right at the start, and then all plots either approaching 100 or 0 based on what they're tracking (S, I, R) for the remainder of the graph.  Adjusting tinitial and tfinal allows us to take a look at specific periods of the infection.\n",

I only have 3 plots for A given the increments from 0.000002 to 0.00004 at 0.000004 increments, so It doesn't look too bad even at lower resolutions.\n",

There are a few ways that you can represent this without even using a graph.  If Bill and Samantha were to use some sort of auto pilot for their cars, then the slopes would be identical, and touching.  If Bill or Samantha were to drive quickly or slowly for either the front half or the back half of the trip, then in order to fulfill the conditions of the problem, the slopes would have to cross (in order to make up the difference).\n",
