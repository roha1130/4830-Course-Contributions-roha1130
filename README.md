## 4830 - Coding Calculus Portfolio

The folder contained within this repo are the accumulated contributions/participation that I have provided to the CSPB 4830 Coding Calculus course for fall 24.  I have included three of the top homework assingments/activities that I completed, as well as the mini project (SIR).  I had a ton of fun digging deeper into SIR modeling, as we have seen the topic before but on a far more rudimentary scale.
